How can such a precise and complicated number have no decimals? To answer this question, we need to dive into the fascinating history of how the meter was defined.</p><hr><h2 id=the-origins-of-the-meter->The Origins of the Meter üìè</h2><p>In <strong>1793</strong>, the meter was defined by the International System of Units as exactly <strong>one ten-millionth of the distance</strong> between the North Pole and the Equator along a meridian. By <strong>1879</strong>, this distance was represented using a <strong>platinum-iridium alloy bar</strong> with marks on each side to denote one meter.</p><p>However, there was a problem: this physical bar was stored in the <strong>International Bureau of Weights and Measures</strong> in S√®vres, France, and not everyone could access it to calibrate instruments. The need for a better, more universal definition was clear.</p><hr><h2 id=redefining-the-meter-with-waves->Redefining the Meter with Waves üåä</h2><p>In <strong>1960</strong>, scientists decided to redefine some units based on the <strong>frequencies and wavelengths</strong> of certain radiations. The meter was then set as <strong>1,650,763.73 wavelengths</strong> of orange-red light emitted by krypton-86 in a vacuum.</p><p>Later, the second was also redefined in <strong>1967</strong>, using the frequency of radiation emitted by cesium-133. (Before this, a second was defined as <strong>1/86,400 of a mean solar day</strong>, which caused inconsistencies.)</p><hr><h2 id=the-modern-definition->The Modern Definition ‚ö°</h2><p>To achieve even greater precision, the definition of the meter changed again: it became the <strong>distance light travels in 1/299,792,458 seconds in a vacuum</strong>. This was possible because:</p><ol><li><strong>The speed of light is constant in a vacuum.</strong></li><li>This constancy is supported by Einstein‚Äôs <strong>special theory of relativity</strong>, which postulates that the speed of light does not change based on time, location, or observer movement.</li></ol><p>While it may seem counterintuitive, this definition is both logical and universally consistent, as long as we specify that it applies in a vacuum.</p><hr><h2 id=why-no-decimals->Why No Decimals? ü§î</h2><p>The reason the speed of light has no decimals lies in the fact that <strong>our definition of the meter depends on it</strong>, not the other way around. Technically, we could have chosen any whole-number value, such as <strong>300,000,000 m/s</strong>, but that would have required changing the definition of the meter.</p><p>This means the number <strong>299,792,458 m/s</strong> isn&rsquo;t arbitrary‚Äîit‚Äôs directly tied to the structure of our system of measurements.</p><hr><h3 id=want-to-test-your-knowledge->Want to Test Your Knowledge? üåï</h3><p>Try solving this challenge: <strong><a href=../moon/>The Moon at the Speed of Light</a></strong>.
